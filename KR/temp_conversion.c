// Reason for multiplying by 5 then dividing by 9 instead of just multiplying by 5/9 is that in C, in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. 5/9 would be truncated to 0, and so
// all Celsius temperatures would be reported as 0.



int main(void) 
{
    float fahr, celsius;
    int lower, upper, step;


    lower = 0;
    upper = 300;
    step = 20;

    fahr = lower;

    while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
        printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr = fahr + step;
    }

}


// This is the same as before except for fahr and celsius being floats, to make the celcius output accurate, as before 0F would output -17, instead of -17.8C
// %3.0f shows F printed three characters wide with no decimal point and no fraction digits. %6.1f tells celsius to be displayed 6 wide with 1 digit after the decimal.
